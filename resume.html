<h3>Major Projects</h3>
HyTech Racing - We're building an electric car to compete in the national Formula Hybrid and Formula SAE competitions. I am on the low-voltage and programming team, with my responsibilities including programming Arduinos to communicate with the battery management system and motor controller over a CAN Bus. In addition, we are planning on using a Raspberry Pi for telemetry.

GIT MAD (Georgia Tech Mobile App Development Club) - We're still in the early stages, but I'm helping to develop an experimental social networking app for Android similar to Twitter or YikYak. I'm working on the post viewer activity.
