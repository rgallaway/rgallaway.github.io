## About

Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a first-year student at Georgia Tech studying computer science. Right now I'm interested in embedded systems thanks to my work with the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HyTechRacing?fref=ts">HyTech Racing</a> club here at Georgia Tech.

My mission in life is to use my skills as a software developer to improve people’s lives. I have a natural inclination to help others, so I am hoping to help create something that will solve a common problem. In my opinion, one of the greatest feelings is when something I did helped make someone else’s life better. Personally, for both myself and others, I value respect, integrity, and the willingness to learn. Throughout my life I have always found enjoyment in learning both useful and useless skills and information. I want to go through life sharing this enjoyment with others through whatever projects I may end up working on.
