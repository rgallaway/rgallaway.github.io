## About

My mission in life is to use my skills as a software developer to improve people’s lives. I have a natural inclination to help others, so I am hoping to help create something that will solve a common problem. In my opinion, one of the greatest feelings is when something I did helped make someone else’s life better. Personally, for both myself and others, I value respect, integrity, and the willingness to learn. Throughout my life I have always found enjoyment in learning both useful and useless skills and information. I want to go through life sharing this enjoyment with others through whatever projects I may end up working on.
