## About

Hi, I'm Ryan. I'm a first-year student at Georgia Tech studying computer science. I'm still in the process of figuring out which areas of the field interest me the most, but I am involved in clubs to gain more experience. For example, in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/HyTechRacing">HyTech Racing</a> , I'm using Arduino microcontrollers and a Raspberry Pi to interface with the motor controller on our electric car to provide for internal communications and telemetry.


My mission in life is to use my skills as a software developer to improve people’s lives. I have a natural inclination to help others, so I am hoping to help create something that will solve a common problem. In my opinion, one of the greatest feelings is when something I did helped make someone else’s life better. Personally, for both myself and others, I value respect, integrity, and the willingness to learn. Throughout my life I have always found enjoyment in learning both useful and useless skills and information. I want to go through life sharing this enjoyment with others through whatever projects I may end up working on.
